# Open Healthcare Statistics

Collecting statistics on open source NHS GitHub and GitLab repositories using end-to-end open source analytics: python, [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), [github.io](https://pages.github.com/), and [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

Open source is the practice of publishing the source code of a piece of software so that anyone can read, modify, re-use that software for thier own purposes. Open source code is typically published under an open-source licence which defines what can--and cannot--be done with the code. For example, under the MIT licence users are allowed to:

> use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and / or sell copies of the software

as long as the MIT licence is included with any derivitve software as well.

As set out in the [NHS Digital Service Manual](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/service-standard/12-make-new-source-code-open), public services are built with public money--so unless there's a good reason not to, all code should be made publicly available for other people to reuse and build upon. To this end, the [Department of Health & Social Care has recently made a commitment](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data-draft/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data-draft) to make all new NHS code open source and published under appropriate licences (such as MIT and OGLv3).
